    "Title": "Transaction Order Dependence",
    "Description": "The Ethereum network processes transactions in blocks, with new blocks getting confirmed approximately every 17 seconds. Miners review the transactions they have received and select which ones to include in a block, based on who has paid a high enough gas price to be included. Additionally, when transactions are sent to the Ethereum network, they are forwarded to each node for processing. Thus, a person who is running an Ethereum node can tell which transactions are going to occur before they are finalized. A race condition vulnerability occurs when code depends on the order of the transactions submitted to it. The simplest example of a race condition is when a smart contract gives a reward for submitting information. Suppose a contract will give out 1 token to the first person who solves a math problem. Alice solves the problem and submits the answer to the network with a standard gas price. Eve runs an Ethereum node and can see the answer to the math problem in the transaction that Alice submitted to the network. So, Eve submits the answer to the network with a much higher gas price, and thus it gets processed and committed before Alice's transaction. Eve receives one token, and Alice gets nothing, even though it was Alice who worked to solve the problem. A common way this occurs in practice is when a contract rewards people for calling out bad behavior in a protocol by giving a bad actor's deposit to the person who proved they were misbehaving. The race condition that happens most frequently on the network today is the race condition in the ERC20 token standard. The ERC20 token standard includes a function called 'approve', which allows an address to approve another address to spend tokens on their behalf. Assume that Alice has approved Eve to spend n of her tokens, then Alice decides to change Eve's approval to m tokens. Alice submits a function call to approve with the value n for Eve. Eve runs an Ethereum node, so she knows that Alice is going to change her approval to m. Eve then submits a transferFrom request, sending n of Alice's tokens to herself, but gives it a much higher gas price than Alice's transaction. The transferFrom executes first so gives Eve n tokens and sets Eve's approval to zero. Then Alice's transaction executes and sets Eve's approval to m. Eve then sends those m tokens to herself as well. Thus, Eve gets n + m tokens, even though she should have gotten at most max(n,m).",

    "Remediation": "A possible way to remedy race conditions in the submission of information in exchange for a reward is called a commit reveal hash scheme. Instead of submitting the answer, the party who has the answer submits hash(salt, address, answer) [salt being some number of their choosing]; the contract stores this hash and the sender's address. To claim the reward, the sender then submits a transaction with the salt, and answer. The contract hashes (salt, msg.sender, answer) and checks the hash produced against the stored hash. If the hash matches, the contract releases the reward. The best fix for the ERC20 race condition is to add a field to the inputs of approve, which is the expected current value, and to have approve revert if Eve's current allowance is not what Alice indicated she was expecting. However, this means that your contract no longer conforms to the ERC20 standard. If it is important to your project to have the contract conform to ERC20, you can add a safe approve function. From the user's perspective, it is possible to mitigate the ERC20 race condition by setting approvals to zero before changing them.",

Moreover, malicious miners can alter the timestamp of their blocks, especially if they can gain advantages by doing so. However, miners can't set a timestamp smaller than the previous one (otherwise the block will be rejected), nor can they set the timestamp too far ahead in the future. Taking all of the above into consideration, developers can't rely on the preciseness of the provided timestamp. As for block.number, considering the block time on Ethereum is generally about 14 seconds, it's possible to predict the time delta between blocks. However, block times are not constant and are subject to change for a variety of reasons, e.g. fork reorganisations and the difficulty bomb.

A limitation for such systems is that smart contracts can not directly interact with them because they can not sign messages. Some signature verification implementations attempt to solve this problem by assuming the validity of a signed message based on other methods that do not have this limitation. An example of such a method is to rely on msg.sender and assume that if a signed message originated from the sender address then it has also been created by the sender address.

    "Description": "Contracts can behave erroneously when they strictly assume a specific Ether balance.

In the worst case scenario this could lead to DOS conditions that might render the contract unusable.",

    "Title": "Hash Collisions With Multiple Variable Length Arguments",
    "Description": "Using abi.encodePacked() with multiple variable length arguments can, in certain situations, lead to a hash collision. Since abi.encodePacked() packs all elements in order regardless of whether they're part of an array, you can move elements between arrays and, so long as all elements are in the same order, it will return the same encoding. In a signature verification situation, an attacker could exploit this by modifying the position of elements in a previous function call to effectively bypass authorization.",

      "CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay"
    ],
    "Remediation": "When using abi.encodePacked(), it's crucial to ensure that a matching signature cannot be achieved using different parameters. To do so, either do not allow users access to parameters used in abi.encodePacked(), or use fixed length arrays. Alternatively, you can simply use abi.encode() instead. It is also recommended that you use replay protection (see SWC-121), although an attacker can still bypass this by front-running.",

    "Description": "The transfer() and send() functions forward a fixed amount of 2300 gas. Historically, it has often been recommended to use these functions for value transfers to guard against reentrancy attacks. However, the gas cost of EVM instructions may change significantly during hard forks which may break already deployed contract systems that make fixed assumptions about gas costs.  For example. EIP 1884 broke several existing smart contracts due to a cost increase of the SLOAD instruction.",

    "Description": "In Solidity, it's possible to write code that does not produce the intended effects. Currently, the solidity compiler will not return a warning for effect-free code. This can lead to the introduction of \"dead\" code that does not properly perform an intended action. For example, it's easy to miss the trailing parentheses in msg.sender.call.value(address(this).balance)(\"\");, which could lead to a function proceeding without transferring funds to msg.sender. Although, this should be avoided by checking the return value of the call.",
